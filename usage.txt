usage: hip <action> [<args>]

hip automatically generates the boilerplate code for creating new projects that
use React, Typescript and Eslint + Prettier. It also allows for the generation
of new objects, such as Components, Contexts, Pages and Models.

Actions are top level commands that dictate what hip should do, currently there
are two that have been implemented:

    init    Creates a new project.
    new     Creates a new object.
    format  Runs the format script defined in init with the --silent option.

The 'init' requires the name of the project be provided, and that node and npm
are installed. It will:

    1. Create the project using 'create-react-app --typescript'.
    2. Install NodeSass for stylesheets.
    3. Install ESLint, Prettier, and the plugins required to ensure they work.
    4. Create a new script to format code in accordance with Prettier's style.
    5. Remove create-react-app cruft.
    6. Setup folders for objects.
    7. Setup an App component in 'src/'.

The 'new' action supports creating a new Component, Page, Model or Context and
follows a simple convention for where these objects should be created. The
options are listed below:

    component   Will create a new component in the src/components folder.
    page        Will create a new page in the src/pages folder.
    model       Will create a new model in the src/models folder.
    context     Will create a new context in the src/contexts folder.

When calling 'new' with an object type specified a name must also be provided,
and it must be called from the project root (directory where package.json is
located).
